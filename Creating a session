### To set up a session follow the steps below.

On the otree admin page create a session with 50 participants, i.e. the total number of participants that are supposed
to participate in the trust study. It is important to create 1 session for all 50 participants, in order to ensure that
the randomization of judgments to participants happens in a balanced way.

Just leave the server running until all (lab) sessions are done, i.e. until all 50 participants have gone through the
lab. Start clients working your way chronologically through the list of links such that the final participant, will play
on the 50th link.
